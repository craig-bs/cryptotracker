## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.0+
- Redis (for Celery task queue)
- APE framework (for blockchain interactions)

### Common Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:0xthedance/cryptotracker.git
   cd cryptotracker
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```
   export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   export WEB3_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID=your_alchemy_project_id
   export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
   export THE_GRAPH_API_KEY=your_graph_api_key
   export COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_coingecko_api_key

   ```

   - **WEB3_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID**: Required for blockchain interactions via Alchemy.
   - **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Used for fetching blockchain data from Etherscan.
   - **API_KEY_THE_GRAPH**: Required for querying data from The Graph.
   - **COINGECKO_API_KEY**: Used for fetching cryptocurrency price data.

### Run Locally

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Load Initial Data**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py initialize_db
   ```

5. **Setup Invite System** (Optional):
   This command creates an initial admin user and generates sample invite codes:
   ```bash
   python manage.py setup_invite_system
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Start Celery Worker**:
   If you don't have Redis running, you can do it with:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:latest
   ```

   Then start celery with:
   ```bash
   celery -A dcp worker --loglevel=info
   ```

8. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Run in Production Using Docker Compose

1. **Additional Environment Variables for Production**:
   Modify  `.env` file with your preferences:
   ```
   export REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
   export DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your_production_domain
   export DJANGO_DEBUG=False
   ```
   - **REDIS_URL**: Specifies the Redis connection string for Celery.
   - **DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS**: Specifies the allowed hosts for the production environment.
   - **DJANGO_DEBUG**: Set to `False` for production.

2. **Build and Run the Application**:
   Use `docker-compose.yml` to build and run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://$IP_HOST:8000`.

## Usage

### For Regular Users

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account using a valid invite code (first user becomes admin automatically).
2. **Add UserAddresses**: Add your cryptocurrency wallet addresses.
3. **View Portfolio**: Monitor your assets, staking balances, and protocol participation.
4. **Refresh Data**: Use the "Refresh" button to fetch the latest data.
5. **Explore Statistics**: View detailed statistics for wallets and accounts.

### For Admin Users

Admin users have access to additional functionality through the Admin tab:

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Click the "Admin" tab in the navigation.
2. **Generate Invite Codes**: Create new invite codes for user registration.
3. **Manage Invite Codes**: View all codes, their status, and revoke unused codes.
4. **User Management**: View all users and promote/demote admin status.
5. **Monitor Usage**: Track which codes have been used and by whom.

### Invite Code System

- **First User**: The very first user to sign up automatically becomes admin and doesn't need an invite code.
- **Subsequent Users**: Must provide a valid, unused invite code to register.
- **Code Generation**: Only admins can generate invite codes.
- **Code Status**: Invite codes can be active, used, or revoked.
- **Security**: Each invite code can only be used once.

## Management Commands

### setup_invite_system
Sets up the invite code system with initial data:
- Creates admin user if no users exist (username: admin, password: admin123)
- Generates 5 sample invite codes for testing

```bash
python manage.py setup_invite_system
```

### Available Commands
- `initialize_db`: Load basic application data (networks, tokens, etc.)
- `setup_invite_system`: Configure invite system and create initial admin user
- Other Django management commands as usual

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Celery, Celery Beat
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth system with custom user profiles
- **Blockchain**: Web3.py, Ape Framework
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Django templates and Bulma CSS)
- **Task Queue**: Redis + Celery

## Security Considerations

- **Invite Code System**: Only admins can generate invite codes, ensuring controlled access.
- **First User Protection**: The first user is automatically made admin to prevent lockout.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admin status cannot be toggled by users themselves (except when changing other users).
- **Code Uniqueness**: Each invite code is unique and can only be used once.
- **Code Revocation**: Admins can revoke unused invite codes if needed.

## Contributing

When contributing to this project, please note the invite code system restrictions:
- New users will need invite codes for testing (unless you reset the database).
- Use `setup_invite_system` command to quickly set up test environment.
- Admin functionality is restricted to users with admin status.
